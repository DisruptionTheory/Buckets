What is Buckets?
=======

Buckets in a small tool written to help visualize the characteristics of certain hashing algorithms.

Requirements
============

Buckets was written fully in managed c# and has no dependencies besides the .NET framework. 
As it uses no unmanaged or Windows specific code, it should work under mono 2.10 or higher, but I make no promises. 

How to Build
============
Simply download the repository and open the Visual Studio Solution. There are no external dependencies. Just open, build, and run.
